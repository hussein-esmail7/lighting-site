    <h1>What I'm Working On</h1>
    <p>In 2019 I started my undergraduate degree at York University for a 
        Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I still attend there even 
        during COVID-19 through online classes. During the COVID-19 quarantine, 
        I am taking summer classes at my university and programming in Python 
        and learning the UNIX terminal.</p>
    <h2>Some of my projects</h2>
    <p>Recently, I've been continuing to make python programs that do moderately complex automations for me (because I am a programmer, and all programmers are lazy).</p>
    <p>Recently, I've been trying to learn more of the UNIX/Linux terminal.</p>


    <h1>Things I'd Like to Share</h1>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            This page is going to be more of a catch-all of things that I might want to 
            share, from <a href="https://reddit.com">Reddit</a> posts to some 
            random <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a>video. At some point, I'll 
            try to figure out how to configure it to use RSS as well, but for now it'll 
            just be coded in HTML here.
